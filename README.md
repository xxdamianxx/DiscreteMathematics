# DiscreteMathematics

On page 9 of my CSE15 Discrete Mathematics Final you'll find the algorithm I executed using a Ti-89 Titanium Calculator to solve 9mod137 = 9, this gave birth to Artificial Intelligence. On page 4 you'll find the same reasoning behind Pi-Factorization where a rational number is multiplied with an irrational number to produce a real number in the form or (p/q) * Ï€ = R.
